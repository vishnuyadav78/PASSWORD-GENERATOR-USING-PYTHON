# INTRODUCTION
Passwords are a means by which a user proves that they are authorized to use a device. It is important that passwords must be long and complex. It should contain at least more than ten characters with a combination of characters such as percent (%), commas(,), and parentheses, as well as lower-case and upper-case alphabets and numbers. Here we will create a random password using Python code.

# Modules needed

string – For accessing string constants. The ones we would need are –

1. string.ascii_letters:  ASCII is a system that is used to represent characters digitally, every ASCII character has its own unique code. string.ascii_letters is a string constant which contains all the letters in ASCII ranging from A to Z and a to z. Its value is non-locale dependent and it is just a concatenation of ascii_uppercase and ascii_lowercase. Thus it provides us the whole letter set as a string that can be used as desired.
   
2. string.digits:  This is a pre-initialized string that contains all the digits in the Arabic numeral system i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It should be kept in mind that even though these are digits, the type is still a string constant, and all digits are concatenated like this – “0123456789”. If we want to access specific numbers then we can do so using slicing.
  
3. string.punctuation: Apart from letters and digits, python also provides us all the special characters in a pre-initialized string constant. These include various kinds of braces, logical operators, comparison operators, arithmetical operators as well as punctuation marks like commas, inverted commas, periods, exclamations marks, and question marks. The whole string is – !”#$%&'()*+, -./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~


# RANDOM


random – The python random module helps a user to generate pseudo-random numbers. Inside the module, there are various functions that just depend on the function “random()”. This function generates a random float uniformly in the semi-open range [0.0, 1.0) i.e. it generates a decimal number greater than or equal to 0 and strictly less than one. Other functions use this number in their own ways. These functions can be used for bytes, integers, and sequences. for our task, we are interested in sequences. There are functions random. choices that take in a sequence as its argument and return a random element from that sequence. 


# Code Implementation:


First, take the length of the password as input. Then we can display a prompt about the possible list of characters that a user wants to include in the password –

# For including letters in the character set append string.ascii_letters in the character list.

# For including letters in the character set append string.digits in the character list.

# For including letters in character set append string.punctuation in the character list. 


# Understanding the Requirements of the Project

In order to build a Random Password Generator in Python, we will require a good understanding of Programming in Python, such as the working of operators, loops, and functions. We will also use some data structures such as strings, lists, and more.

Moreover, we will use different methods of the Python random module that will allow us to select among different values randomly. Some of the most important methods of the random module are randint(), sample(), seed(), choice(), and many more.

If the following Random Password Generator program is, we will make use of some methods of the random module. Let us briefly discuss them before implementing them in the program.

# choice(): The choice() method is considered one of the effective methods of the random module. This method is used to select a random value (or data element) from the given sequence. This sequence can be any sequential data type, such as strings, lists, tuples, or any other sequence of numbers or objects.

# sample(): The sample() method is utilized to acquire a sequence of randomly chosen values from the given input sequence. The sample() method is used to return a list of unique options. The sample() method accepts two arguments. The first argument is the original sequence from which the random sequence output must be generated. The second one is the length of the random sample that must be generated.

In this tutorial, we will also use the Python Tkinter module to adapt a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for the program.

Since both the modules are preinstalled as the Standard libraries of Python, there is no need to install them externally.

So, let us get straight into the implementation part of the project.


# Steps to Build the Random Password Generator in Python

The following are the steps to implement the random password generator in Python:

# Step 1: Firstly, we will import the required modules.

# Step 2: We will define a function to generate a password using all alphanumeric characters.

# Step 3: We will update the program to accept the password length as the user input.

# Step 4: We will update the program again to generate multiple passwords.

# Step 5: Finally, we will integrate Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the Password Generator using Tkinter.

Let us now understand the implementation of the above steps in detail.

# Defining a Function to Generate the Password using All Alphanumeric Characters


Now that we have imported all the necessary modules in the program, it is time to start defining a function that will allow us to generate the password with the help of all alphanumeric characters.

# Step 1: We will start by defining a function that will return a randomly generated password. This function will accept one parameter signifying the length of the password to be generated.

# Step 2: We will create a string or list containing all the alphabets (small and capital letters), numbers, and symbols.

# Step 3: We will initialize an empty string to store the randomly chosen password.

# Step 4: At last, we will run a loop iterating from 0 to the length of the password. We will randomly select a character from the character list with the help of the random.choice() method and add the selected character to the password string. Finally, we will return the password string.


# Integrating GUI to the Password Generator using Tkinter

Tkinter is a standard Python library used for the development of GUI applications in Python.

The following are the steps we will follow to integrate the GUI into the Password Generator using the Tkinter package:

# Step 1: Import the required modules.

# Step 2: Define the necessary functions.

# Step 3: Create the main window for the application.

# Step 4: Add the Widgets to the window.

# Step 5: Running the Application.



# Importing the Necessary Modules


We will import the random module along with the modules and widgets from the Tkinter module. Apart from these modules, we must import the messagebox module from Tkinter. The messagebox module is utilized to display any error, warning, and important message in a message box.


# Defining the Required Functions


Now that we have imported the required modules, we must define the functions necessary to implement different operations in the application. We will define functions to generate the password, check if the selection is appropriate, retrieve the length of the password, and reset everything in the application.
